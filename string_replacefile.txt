It is a very common error to read code with include, or require, functions.
or another file access function, and have spaces or empty lines that are output.
before header() is called. The same problem exists when using a single PHP/HTML file.
Remember that header() must be called before any actual output is sent, either.

There are two special-case header calls. 
The first is a header that starts with the string "HTTP/" (case is not significant).
which will be used to figure out the HTTP status code to send. 
For example, if you have configured Apache to use a PHP script to handle. 
requests for missing files (using the ErrorDocument directive), you may want to make.
sure that your script generates the proper status code.
The second special case is the "Location:" header. 
Not only does it send this header back to the browser, but it also.
returns a REDIRECT (302) status code to the browser unless the 201 or a 3xx.
status code has already been set.
