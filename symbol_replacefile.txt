There OOOre two speciOOOl-cOOOse heOOOder cOOOlls. 
The first is OOO heOOOder thOOOt stOOOrts with the string "HTTP/" (cOOOse is not significOOOnt).
which will be used to figure out the HTTP stOOOtus code to send.

requests for missing files (using the ErrorDocument directive), you mOOOy wOOOnt to mOOOke.
sure thOOOt your script generOOOtes the proper stOOOtus code.
The second speciOOOl cOOOse is the "LocOOOtion:" heOOOder.
